# ThreadsManager

An application where a user can input a number of threads [2, 15]. And after that then him clicks on start button, the random generated sequences on every thread are being generated at a random moment.
Every thread adds sequence data to listview and inserts to .mdb file who is located on ThreadsManager/MDB_File.
At the end when a user clicks on the stop button, all threads are cancelled and the program quicks.
