# ThreadsManager

An application where a user can input a number of threads [2, 15]. And after that when he clicks on the start button, the random generated sequences on every thread are being generated at a random(05,..2.0s) moment.
Every thread adds sequences data to a listview and inserts to .mdb file who is located on ThreadsManager/MDB_File.
At the end when a user clicks on the stop button, all threads are cancelled and the program quicks.
